          <p>
            Hi, I'm Nurzhanat Zhussup, a passionate software engineer and data
            scientist with a deep curiosity for technology. I'm 22 and born in
            Almaty, Kazakhstan üá∞üáø‚õ∞Ô∏è
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently based in Vienna, Austria üá¶üáπ. I hold a degree in
            Economics from WU Vienna, which initially steered me towards a
            career in finance and data science. However, as I explored more
            about the tech world, I discovered my love for programming. This
            sparked my transition into software engineering. I have since honed
            my skills in web development, focusing on both frontend and backend
            technologies. Also, I am very much into AI and possess very good
            knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Engineering. I am the type of
            guy who simply enjoys coding and building stuff :)

          <p>
            I absolutely love skiing, and it's probably on the same level as
            coding for me, as I can't imagine my life without these two
            passions. :) In addition to skiing, I enjoy playing tennis and
            hiking regularly. I'm also an avid learner, often watching Udemy
            courses as part of my self-development. Recently, I've started
            reading tech books to expand my knowledge further. Outside of these
            activities, I like to stay curious about the latest trends in
            technology and continuously seek new ways to improve both
            professionally and personally. Whether it's tackling a coding
            challenge or exploring the outdoors, I'm always looking for new
            experiences to grow and learn.
