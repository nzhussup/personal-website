      "text2": "I am currently based in Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹. I hold a degree in Economics from WU Vienna, which initially steered me towards a career in finance or the economics field. However, after taking a data science specialization, I discovered my love for coding. As I explored more of the tech world, my passion for programming grew stronger. I then realized that I truly wanted to be in the tech industry, which sparked my transition into software engineering. Since then, I have gained extensive skills in web development, focusing on both frontend and backend technologies. Additionally, with my specialization in data science, I possess strong knowledge of Machine Learning and Data Engineering. So, briefly speaking, I am just a guy who enjoys building things and learning something new. :)"

I also frequently watch Udemy courses as part of my self-development. Additionally, I like spending my time reading tech books to further expand my knowledge. Outside of these activities, I stay curious about the latest trends in technology and continuously seek new ways to improve both professionally and personally. Whether it's tackling a coding challenge or exploring the outdoors, I'm always looking for new experiences to grow and learn."
